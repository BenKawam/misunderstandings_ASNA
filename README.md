## Dependencies in Animal Social Networks

In this repository, we run a series of simulations, where we show how five simple causal structures create statistical associations (_i.e._ dependencies) between observed edges of synthetic social networks.
The simulations can be found in the `dep_SN` html/quarto Notebook.
The other files and folder in the source directory are either inputs, outputs, or both, of code in the Notebook.
